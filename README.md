# nuget
Tools to help use NuGet packages from Dyalog APL

Requires Dyalog v19.0 and .NET 6.0 or later.

Note on November 10th 2023: This code is now loaded into pre-releases of v19.0 as ⎕SE.Dyalog.NuGet and used by Cider. This repo needs to be cleaned up and documented for people who might want to use the code independently of Cider; this will happen in time for the v19.0 release.

In addition this code is available as a Tatin package on [the official Tatin server](https://tatin.dev/).

At the moment, the Tests folder can be used as examples of its use, but note that this code assumes the code has been loaded as ⎕SE.NuGet.
